<h1>Interactives</h1>
<p>For Jour 320, I've created two graphics: a barchart visualizing the percentage of student identities held at each public high school, relative to their student bodies; the second is a map detailing the location of Chicago Public High Schools – the map itself is divvied into zip codes, each of which are "colored" by median household income.</p>

<h3>Datasets of Interest and Data Aggregation</h3>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p>The barchart I’ve created measures the percentage of student identities in Chicago Public High Schools, relative to the entirety of their student bodies. I’d like to note, several other student identities were listed in the dataset, including Native American and Asian Pacific Islander; however, due to minimal reporting, I chose not to include these identities.</p>

<p>The map I've created illustrates the geographic location of each Chicago Public High School. The delineated regions of the map are zip codes and are colored by median household income. The darker a zip code's coloring, the greater its median household income.</p>

<h3>Trends Gathered</h3>
<p>Chicago Public High Schools do not, necessarily, densely populate a single zip code; however, fewer public schools are located in zip codes with median household incomes greater than $135,000. To that end, zip codes with median household incomes greater than $135,000 are largely concentrated in northern Chicago.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>I find the trends I’ve gathered to be of interest as they beg the questions: (1) are student-aged residents of zip codes with median household incomes greater than $135,000 instead attending private schools? (2) what are the demographics of these private schools? and (3) do schools located within zip codes of median household incomes greater than $135,000 perform better than those located elsewhere?</p>
