<h1>AI Experimentation</h1>
    <p>Prior to Jour 320, I hadn’t experimented much with AI – namely, ChatGPT. The notion “ChatGPT is disrupting our workforce” had gotten to me, and I was in no state to enter a tentative quid pro quo. (I’d like to note, I’m incredibly intentional – and cautious – with my questions and have no desire for my writing (my voice!) to enter its system.) However, as l am not all that technological savvy, ChatGPT proved to be an ally of sorts whilst creating my portfolio – particularly in terms of design.
    </p>
    <p>For whatever reason (my anxiety, I’d presume), I cannot move forward with an assignment until I’ve determined my prep to be sufficient (read: perfect). As such, when I was unable to design the base layer of my portfolio as intended – I could not implement my font of choice – I shut down, which feels rather silly to confess. Alas, I did and found I was a bit lost. A tough-love moment was necessary in which I told myself aesthetics be damned (temporarily!), I had an assignment to complete. I’d gotten around to completing other tasks (fear not!), though I’d rather share how I’d gotten myself out of this “aesthetic pickle.” Yes, reader, it involves ChatGPT.</p>
    <p>Much to my surprise, ChatGPT converses much as a human would, and I found the site rather easy to navigate. My query, and its resolution, is not terribly scientific, nor experimental, though I’ll write of it as such. First, I’d asked ChatGPT, “how do I add a font to HTML?”. ChatGPT then provided me with the requisite code to imitate and the site, Google Fonts, to select and implement my desired font. Really, it was that easy. I’ll remain cautious of ChatGPT, though I’ve decided it’s immensely helpful for those interested in diversifying their skillset (Exhibit A: me) and ought to be applauded accordingly.</p>
