<h1>Intentions</h1>
<p>In terms of career aspirations, I intend to enter the economics sector post-grad, wherein I’d apply the skills I’ve acquired in both my journalism and economics courses – namely, thorough reporting, a fundamental understanding of personal finance and keen inquiry, always (à la Medill, the story is never, truly, finished). This coming summer, I’ll intern with Raymond James within their internal audit unit. Ideally, I’d hope to receive a return offer – I’m rather familiar with the company and am confident I’d thrive, both professionally and personally – and enter their workforce, before I return to my education. Much, much further down the line, I hope to have acquired enough “niche” economic knowledge to have a column of my own in either the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times.</p>
<p>As for my portfolio intentions, I wanted to both learn and practice web-development, data wrangling (to be so technical) and interactive storytelling. There’s always (always!) more to learn, and I could certainly be a better coder, though I’m proud of what I’ve created and am excited to see how I’ll grow in the years to come.</p>
<p>Moving forward, I’d love to develop several more projects that better align with my career ambitions to share in my portfolio. I’ll settle for the pieces I’m most proud of for the time being. If anything, I’d argue they illustrate, rather well, my linguistic abilities and creative interests.</p>
