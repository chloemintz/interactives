<h1>A Bit About Me!</h1>

<p>Hi there! My name is Chloe Mintz, and I'm a third-year at Northwestern University. I'm double-majoring in Journalism and Economics, with a minor in Creative Writing. At the moment, I'm studying HTML, and I'm trying (trying, being the operative word!) to create a website of my own!</p>

<div>
<h2>Things I Love</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reading, of course (particularly novels of Sally Rooney)</li>
	<li>Fancy dinner parties, which are never quite as fancy as I'd like</li>
	<li>Copious amounts of sugar</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Things I Detest</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Open-mouthed chewing</li>
	<li>Insincere niceties</li>
	<li>Any cold, wet thing, Ã  la Bella Swan</li>
</ul>
</div>
