<h1>A Bit About Me!</h1>

<p>Hi there! My name is Chloe Mintz, and I'm a third-year at Northwestern University. I'm double-majoring in Journalism and Economics, with a minor in Creative Writing. At the moment, I'm studying HTML, and I'm trying ("trying" being the operative word!) to create a website of my own!</p>
